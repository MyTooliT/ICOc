## Version 1.2.0

### ICOc

- ICOc now assumes that sensor ranges reported by an STH below 1 (i.e. ± 0.5 g) are incorrect. In this case ICOc will assume that the range is ± 100 g instead.

### STH Test

- The acceleration sensor self test (`test_acceleration_self_test`) now uses the [new CAN class](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/blob/8f995cbd/mytoolit/can/network.py).

### SMH Test

- We added a basic test for the new sensory milling hardware (SMH). To execute the test, please use the command

  ```sh
  test-smh
  ```

  Currently the test:

  - checks if the STU is able to **connect** to the device,
  - checks if the raw **ADC sensor values** are roughly equal to the expected values, and
  - writes, reads and checks the **EEPROM** values of the SMH.

### Internal

#### Calibration

- We added a class to create [“Calibration Measurement”][] message data bytes

[“calibration measurement”]: https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command:Calibration-Measurement

#### Message

- The textual representation of the message class now includes an extended description for

  - [Bluetooth commands](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command-bluetooth)
  - [“Calibration Measurement” commands][“calibration measurement”] , and
  - [streaming commands](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#block-streaming).

#### Network

We added methods

- to activate and deactivate the self test of the accelerometer
- to measure the acceleration voltage
- to read the advertisement time and sleep time of the reduced energy mode (mode 1)
