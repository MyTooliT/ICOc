## Version 1.2.0

### ICOc

- ICOc now assumes that sensor ranges reported by an STH below 1 (i.e. ± 0.5 g) are incorrect. In this case ICOc will assume that the range is ± 100 g instead.

### Internal

#### Calibration

- We added a class to create [“Calibration Measurement”][] message data bytes

[“calibration measurement”]: https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command:Calibration-Measurement

#### Message

- The textual representation of the message class now includes an extended description for [“Calibration Measurement”][] commands

#### Network

We added methods

- to activate and deactivate the self test of the accelerometer
- to measure the acceleration voltage
