## Version 1.3.0

### SMH Test

- We added a flash upload test for the sensory milling head PCB. To only execute this part of the SMH test you can use the following command:

  ```sh
  test-smh -k flash
  ```

### Internal

#### ICOc

- The streaming code now uses CAN read events instead of polling.

#### Logging

- We do not log the CAN streaming messages (every CAN message after you chose “Start Data Acquisition” in ICOc) any more. The reason behind this change is that ICOc is currently not able to handle logging and writing the data into a HFD5 file at the same time on “slower” processors (such as Intel’s Core i5-5300 @ 2.3 GHz).

#### Network

- We added methods to read and write the sleep and advertisement time values of a sensor device using [`System` (Bluetooth)](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command:bluetooth) commands
- The method `connect_sth` is now called `connect_sensor_device`
