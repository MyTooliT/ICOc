## Version 1.4.0

### ICOc

#### Logging

We replaced our custom logging class in the ICOc command line interface with logging code from the Python standard library. This logging code stores data in the following files:

- `cli.log`: Log messages of ICOc
- `network.log`: Log messages of CAN network class
- `plotter.log`: Log messages of plotter (window process)

By default ICOc only write log messages of level `ERROR` or higher into theses files. To print more detailed output you can use the option `--log` to change the log level. For example, to change the log level to `DEBUG` (or higher) you can use the the following command:

```sh
icoc --log debug
```

The other parts of the code, which use the old `Network` class (e.g. the verification test) do not store the log output in files, but instead use the standard error output (`stdout`). This change should hopefully improve the visibility of important log messages.
