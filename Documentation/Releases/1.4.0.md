## Version 1.4.0

### ICOc

#### Logging

- We replaced our custom logging class in the ICOc command line interface with logging code from the Python standard library. This logging code does not write log entries to a text file like before, but to the standard error output (`stderr`) instead. This should improve the visibility of important log messages. By default ICOc only prints log messages of level `WARNING` or higher. To print more detailed output you can use the option `--log` to change the log level. For example, to change the log level to `DEBUG` (or higher) you can use the the following command:

  ```sh
  icoc --log debug
  ```
