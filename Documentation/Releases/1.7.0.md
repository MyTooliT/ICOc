## Version 1.7.0

### Style

- We now use [Black][] instead of [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format the code base, since Black:
  - supports the latest Python features (e.g. `match`/`case` and `except*`) and
  - splits long strings (experimental feature).

[Black]: https://github.com/psf/black

### Tests

- We added a (very basic) [Prysk](https://pypi.org/project/prysk/) test for the command line tool `icon`

### Internal

#### Network

- Collected streaming data now also contains the message counter value
