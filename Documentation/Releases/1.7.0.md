## Version 1.7.0

### Configuration

- We added support for a [user configuration file](https://mytoolit.github.io/ICOc/#introduction:section:changing-configuration-values) that can be used to overwrite values in the [default configuration](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/blob/3e7ebde288b9e728b00c8b86ae37454ca767728b/mytoolit/config/config.yaml).

### Package

- Require Python `3.9` or later
- Uploaded package to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/icoc/), which means you can now install ICOc via:

  ```sh
  pip install icoc
  ```

### Scripts

- We removed the `clean-repo` command

#### Hardware Tests

- The SMH, STH and STU tests now store the PDF test report in the current working directory

#### ICOc

- The command now stores log files inside the current working directory

#### ICOn

##### Config

- The [new subcommand `config`](https://mytoolit.github.io/ICOc/#tutorials:section:opening-the-user-configuration) can be used to open the user configuration file.

##### Measurement

- Add the possibility to change the measurement duration (option `-t`, `--time`)
- Store data in HDF5 format

##### STU

- Add `reset` command

### Style

- We now use [Black][] instead of [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format the code base, since Black:
  - supports the latest Python features (e.g. `match`/`case` and `except*`) and
  - splits long strings (experimental feature).

### Tests

- We added two (very basic) [Prysk](https://pypi.org/project/prysk/) tests for the command line tool `icon`

### Internal

#### ADC

- We added methods to read the

  - prescaler,
  - acquisition time,
  - oversampling rate and
  - the sample rate

  of ADC configuration objects (class `ADCConfiguration`).

#### Network

- Collected streaming data now also contains the message counter value
- Fixed reading data from multiple channels

#### Streaming Data

- We added the method `default`, which can be used to serialize data (into JSON format)

#### Storage

- We added the method `add_streaming_data`, which can be used to directly add `StreamingData` objects to the (HDF5) storage.
