## Version 1.7.0

### Package

- Require Python `3.9` or later
- Uploaded package to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/icoc/), which means you can now install ICOc via:

  ```sh
  pip install icoc
  ```

### Scripts

- We removed the `clean-repo` command

#### Hardware Tests

- The SMH, STH and STU tests now store the PDF test report in the current working directory

#### ICOc

- The command now stores log files inside the current working directory

#### ICOn

##### Measurement

- Add the possibility to change the measurement duration (option `-t`, `--time`)
- Store data in HDF5 format

##### STU

- Add `reset` command

### Style

- We now use [Black][] instead of [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format the code base, since Black:
  - supports the latest Python features (e.g. `match`/`case` and `except*`) and
  - splits long strings (experimental feature).

[Black]: https://github.com/psf/black

### Tests

- We added a (very basic) [Prysk](https://pypi.org/project/prysk/) test for the command line tool `icon`

### Internal

#### ADC

- We added methods to read the

  - prescaler,
  - acquisition time,
  - oversampling rate and
  - the sample rate

  of ADC configuration objects (class `ADCConfiguration`).

#### Network

- Collected streaming data now also contains the message counter value
- Fixed reading data from multiple channels

#### Streaming Data

- We added the method `default`, which can be used to serialize data (into JSON format)

#### Storage

- We added the method `add_streaming_data`, which can be used to directly add `StreamingData` objects to the (HDF5) storage.
