## Version 2.0.0

### API

### Measurement

- The method `convert_raw_to_g` now returns a float instead of a `Quantity`. If you still like to use a Quantity, you can just apply the function `g0` on the result.

#### Network

- Removed the coroutines:

  - `read_streaming_data_seconds` and
  - `read_streaming_data_amount`

  Please just use `open_data_stream` and `async for`, if you want to replace code that used these coroutines.

- Added the coroutine `shutdown` again: You can use this method, if you want to shutdown the bus manually

#### Streaming

- We **changed the interface (data structure) for accessing streaming data** to [improve the performance](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/issues/40) when working with the high frequency data of the ICOtronic system.

- Add the amount of lost messages to the data returned by the iterator over the streaming data

- Removed the class `TimestampedValue`
