## Version 1.0.9

### Configuration

- We moved the [configuration file for the test scripts][config] into the `mytoolit` package.
- We moved the [configuration file for ICOc](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/blob/7035ff18/mytoolit/old/configKeys.xml) into the `mytoolit` package.
- We now use uppercase letters for all configuration keys in [`config.yaml`][config]. The reason behind this update is that we can overwrite these values using environment variables – with the prefix `DYNACONF_` – even on Windows. Unfortunately Windows [converts all environment variables to uppercase](https://www.dynaconf.com/configuration).

[config]: https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/blob/7035ff18/mytoolit/config/config.yaml

### Compatibility

- This version of ICOc requires at least Python `3.7`, since we use the `annotations` directive from the `__futures__` module

### Package

- We added a [package description](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/blob/7035ff18/setup.py) for ICOc. You can now install the software using `pip install -e .` in the root of the repository. To uninstall the package use `pip uninstall icoc`.

### Scripts

- We added a new EEPROM checking tool. For more information please take a look at the section “EEPROM Check” of the [script documentation](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/blob/7035ff18/Documentation/Scripts.md).

### Internal

- We removed old hardware test code

#### Network (Old)

- Simplified code
