## Version 1.5.0

### ICOc

#### Command Line

- You can now set/enable the measurement for channel 2 and 3 just by providing the option for the measurement channel without an argument. In this case the measurement channel will be mapped to the corresponding hardware/sensor channel, i.e.

  - measurement channel 2 will use hardware channel 2 and
  - measurement channel 3 will use hardware channel 3.

  Example:

  ```
  icoc -2
  ```

  The command above will use

  - hardware channel 1 for measurement channel 1 (default value),
  - hardware channel 2 for measurement channel 2, and
  - disable measurement channel 3.

#### Logging

- The log level set in the command line interface is now correctly propagated to the CAN class.
