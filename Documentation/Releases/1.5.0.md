## Version 1.5.0

### ICOc

#### Command Line

- You can now set/enable the measurement for channel 2 and 3 just by providing the option for the measurement channel without an argument. In this case the measurement channel will be mapped to the corresponding hardware/sensor channel, i.e.

  - measurement channel 2 will use hardware channel 2 and
  - measurement channel 3 will use hardware channel 3.

  Example:

  ```
  icoc -2
  ```

  The command above will use

  - hardware channel 1 for measurement channel 1 (default value),
  - hardware channel 2 for measurement channel 2, and
  - disable measurement channel 3.

- ICOc can now connect to an STH, which has “no name” using the command line option `-n` (`--name`):

  ```sh
  icoc -n '' # alternatively you can also just use `icoc -n`
  ```

#### Logging

- The log level set in the command line interface is now correctly propagated to the CAN class.

### STH Tests

- The STH test script now uses the hardware version in the configuration (`STH` → `HARDWARE VERSION`) to determine the correct chip for the flash process.

  | Hardware Version | Chip           |
  | ---------------- | -------------- |
  | `1.x.x`          | `BGM113A256V2` |
  | `2.x.x`          | `BGM123A256V2` |

- The test that executes self test now only checks that the absolute difference between the voltage

  - at the the self test and
  - before/after the self test

  is larger than a certain value. Before we always assumed that the voltage at the test is higher than before/after. This does not seem to be the case for certain sensors like the ± 40 g sensor [ADXL356](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl356.html).
