## Version 1.10.0

### Documentation

- Remove release notes from [official (bookdown) documentation](https://mytoolit.github.io/ICOc/)

  If you are interest in the updates between releases:

  - please visit the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/mytoolit/ICOc/releases) or
  - take a look into the directory `Documentation/Releases`

### Internal

#### Network

- The Network class now raises a `CANInitError` (a subclass of `NetworkError`), when it is unable to initialize the CAN connection instead of a more general `NetworkError`.
- Removed the coroutine `shutdown`

#### STU- Test

- The STU test now tries to fix CAN communication problems, after flashing a new firmware on the chip. This fix should get rid of the bus error that might occur otherwise:

  ```
  Bus error: an error counter reached the 'heavy'/'warning' limit
  ```

  and might cause problems in in other tests afterwards.
