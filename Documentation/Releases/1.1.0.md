## Version 1.0.15

### ICOc

- The minimal interval time (for a single log file) is now 1 second. Before the minimum time was 11 seconds. If you entered a value below e.g. `10` (seconds), then ICOc would use the default value of `0` and use only a single log file. While requiring the interval time to be greater than a certain value seems okay, the only way a user would see that the time was not changed was the text `Interval Time: 0s` in the data acquisition menu.
