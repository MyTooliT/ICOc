## Version 1.1.0

### ICOc

#### Command Line Interface

- **Removed unused options** from the command line interface
- All command line arguments should now be **checked for validity** before starting ICOc
- You do not need to connect the PCAN interface to list the help message of the command line interface:

  ```sh
  icoc -h
  ```

  anymore

#### User Interface

- ICOc should now use considerably **less CPU power**.
- The window for a connected STH now also displays the **sensor range** of the acceleration sensor (in multiples of [g₀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth))
- We **removed unused menu items** from the user interface
- The **menu** part of the interface now uses a **border** to distinguish itself from the rest of the interface:

  ```
  ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  │ 1-9: Connect to STH          │
  │                              │
  │   f: Change Output File Name │
  │   n: Change STH Name         │
  │                              │
  │   q: Quit ICOc               │
  └──────────────────────────────┘
  ```

- ICOc now provides **default values** for nearly all configuration inputs
- ICOc does **not crash** any more if your **terminal window is too small** to display the whole interface. The interface will look garbled if you resize the window to a size that does not fit the whole interface. However, it will look fine after you resize the window to a proper size afterwards, **as long as you do not make the window “really small”** (e.g. leave only two lines for ICOc).

#### Errors

- ICOc now prints the error messages at the top of the output. This should make it easier to check the reason of an error.

#### Output

- ICOc now stores **acceleration data in [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5)** format. For more information please take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/mytoolit/ICOc/#documentation).

#### Plotter

- The **plotter window now displays the acceleration values as multiples of g₀** (9.81 m/s²).

#### Removed Functionality

- We **removed** a lot of the **unused, untested and unmaintained functionality** of ICOc:
  - XML configuration
  - Code to write and read EEPROM data using Excel files

### Verification Test

- We enabled most parts of the STH verification test again
