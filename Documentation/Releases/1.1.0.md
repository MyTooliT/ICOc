## Version 1.0.15

### ICOc

- The minimal interval time (for a single log file) is now 1 second. Before the minimum time was 11 seconds. If you entered a value below e.g. `10` (seconds), then ICOc would use the default value of `0` and use only a single log file. While requiring the interval time to be greater than a certain value seems okay, the only way a user would see that the time was not changed was the text `Interval Time: 0s` in the data acquisition menu.
- The **plotter window now displays the acceleration values as multiples of g₀** (9.81 m/s²). Please note that:

  1. You have to set the acceleration sensor (`STH` → `ACCELERATION SENSOR` → `Sensor`) in the [configuration file](../../mytoolit/config/config.yaml) to

     - `ADXL1001` for the ± 100 g₀ sensor or
     - `ADXL1002` for the ± 50 g₀ sensor.

  2. The displayed value will only be correct if you use a 16 bit ADC (default).

- ICOc also stores acceleration data in [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5) format. Please note that this currently only works for single axis sensors.
