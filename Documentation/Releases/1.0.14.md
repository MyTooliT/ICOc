## Version 1.0.14

### Logger

- ICOc now always extend the logging file name with the postfix `_error`, if there was a problem.

  For example, if you use the default name ICOc.txt, then the logging file will be named

  - `ICOc_TIMESTAMP_error.txt` (e.g. `ICOc_2021-08-25_10-23-04_error.txt`) instead of
  - `ICOc_TIMESTAMP.txt` (e.g. `ICOc_2021-08-25_10-23-04.txt`)

  if there were any problems. The behavior of ICOc was similar before. However, the name of the error file could be chosen freely.

### Verification Tests

We added the old code of the STH verification tests. You can now execute these tests using the command

```sh
test-sth-verification
```

For more information about these tests, please take a look at the section “Verification Tests” [here](../Tutorials.md).

#### Message

- The string representation of a message (`repr`) now includes additional information for
  - the [“Bluetooth Write Energy Mode Reduced”](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command:get-set-state) command
  - the EEPROM command [“Read Write Request Counter”](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command-read-write-request-counter)
- The code for the string representation now handles incorrect device number values for the acknowledgment message of the [`Get number of available devices`](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#command:bluetooth:2) properly
- The method `acknowledge` does not ignore the value of the `error` parameter any more
