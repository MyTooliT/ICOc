# Tests

The following text describes some of the measures we should take to keep the software stable.

- Please only push your changes to the `master` branch, if you think there are no new bugs or regressions. The `master` branch **should always contain a working version of the software**.

## Manual Tests

Please run the following tests before you push to the `master` branch.

### ICOc

1. Call the command `ICOc`.
2. Connect to a working STH (Enter the number and press <kbd>‚èé</kbd>)
3. Start the data acquisition (<kbd>s</kbd>)
4. After some time a window displaying the current acceleration of the STH (or SHA) should show up
5. Shake the STH
6. Make sure the window shows the increased acceleration
7. Close the window
8. The programm should now exit, without any error messages

### STH Test

1. Call the command `Test-STH` for a working STH
2. Wait for the command execution
3. Check that the command shows no error messages
4. Open the PDF report (`Report.pdf`) in the repository root and make sure that it includes the correct test data
