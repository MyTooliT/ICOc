## Why Does the Git Staging Area Show Uncommitted Files?

You might wonder why the staging area of this project shows certain uncommitted files (e.g. `.pyc` )that are not part of the repository [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore) file. This is the case, since we assume that you use a [global gitignore file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335420/global-git-ignore) that already contains pattern for these common files.
