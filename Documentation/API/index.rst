ICOc API Documentation
======================

ICOc is

- a set of command line tools (``icoc``, ``icon``, ``test-sth``, â€¦) and
- a Python library

to

- control the ICOtronic system,
- acquire data, and
- test ICOtronic hardware (e.g. stationary transceiver units and sensory tool holders).

This documentation **describes the Python library API** (i.e. how to create programs that use the ICOtronic system). If you want more general information on the command line tools and the ICOtronic system itself we recommend that you check out the `general ICOc documentation`_.
