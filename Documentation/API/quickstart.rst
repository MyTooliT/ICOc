To communicate with the ICOtronic system use the :class:`mytoolit.can.Network`:

.. autoclass:: mytoolit.can.Network

.. note::
   Please ignore the ``sender`` parameter, you will never need to change it. In fact, we are `planning to get rid of the parameter in a future version of ICOc <https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOc/issues/61>`_.
